# Pattern Creation Insights

> Key learnings and best practices discovered during grammar pattern development

## 1. Subject Selection Issues

### "It" with Human Activities

**Problem:** Using "it" as a subject with human activities produces unnatural sentences.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "It is analyzing the data" (unnatural)
- ❌ "It is cooking dinner" (unnatural for human activity)
- ✅ "The data scientist is analyzing the data" (natural)
- ✅ "My dad is cooking dinner" (natural)

**Solution:** Replace "it" with domain-appropriate nouns:

| Domain | Instead of "it" use |
|--------|---------------------|
| Fitness | the athlete |
| Engineering | the engineer |
| Data Science | the data scientist |
| Conservation | the conservationist |
| Cybersecurity | the security analyst |
| Logistics | the logistics manager |
| Pets | the puppy, the dog |
| Home | my dad, my mom |

**When "it" IS appropriate:**
- Weather: "It is raining"
- Time: "It is 5 o'clock"
- Animals (non-human activities): "It is sleeping" (for a cat)

## 2. Subject Grouping by Grammar

Different grammars require different subject groupings:

| Grammar | Groups | Subjects | Forms |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Present Simple** | 2 | I/you/we/they vs he/she/it | base vs verb-s |
| **Present Continuous** | 3 | I vs you/we/they vs he/she/it | am vs are vs is |
| **Past Continuous** | 2 | I/he/she/it vs you/we/they | was vs were |
| **Present Perfect** | 2 | I/you/we/they vs he/she/it | have vs has |
| **Past Simple** | 1 | all | same past form |
| **Modals** | 1 | all | same modal form |
| **Future Simple** | 1 | all | will + base |

### Critical Note: Past Continuous
**"I" uses "was" NOT "were"** - This differs from present continuous where "I" has its own group (am).

```
Present Continuous: I am, you are, he is
Past Continuous:    I was, you were, he was  ← "I" joins "he/she/it" group!
```

## 3. Level Availability by Grammar

Not all grammars start at A1:

| Grammar | A1 | A2 | B1 | B2 | C1 | Total Patterns |
|---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Present Simple | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 50 |
| Present Continuous | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 50 |
| Past Simple | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 50 |
| **Past Continuous** | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 40 |
| **Present Perfect** | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 40 |
| Modals | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 50 |

**Rationale:** More complex tenses (past continuous, present perfect) require foundational grammar knowledge typically acquired at A2+.

## 4. Wrong Forms Strategy by Level

### Basic Strategy (A1-B2)
Test **auxiliary/modal choice** errors:

| Grammar | Correct | Wrong Forms |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Present Continuous (I) | am cooking | is cooking, are cooking, cook |
| Past Continuous (I) | was cooking | were cooking, cooked, am cooking |
| Present Perfect (I) | have visited | has visited, had visited, visited |
| Modals | can swim | could swim, must swim, should swim |

### Advanced Strategy (C1)
Test **grammatical structure** errors, not just choice:

| Correct | Wrong Forms | Tests |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| could transform | should transforms | Conjugation after modal |
| might discover | might discovering | -ing after modal |
| could prove | could proved | Past participle after modal |

**Insight:** C1 learners already know modal meanings; they need to prove they understand modals take base verbs.

## 5. Template Complexity Progression

Templates should increase in complexity by level:

### A1 - Basic SVO
```
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ}.
"I can swim."
```

### A2 - Add Time/Place/Adverb
```
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ} {PLACE}.
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ} {ADVERB}.
"She can speak English fluently."
"You can park here."
```

### B1 - Add Purpose/Reason/Duration
```
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ} because {REASON}.
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ} to {PURPOSE}.
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ} {DURATION}.
"You should exercise regularly to stay healthy."
"They have lived here for five years."
```

### B2 - Add Result/Consequence/Condition
```
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ}, so {RESULT}.
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ} if {CONDITION}.
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ}, which {CONSEQUENCE}.
"The project might succeed if we secure funding."
"The company has expanded, which creates opportunities."
```

### C1 - Multi-clause with Implication/Contrast
```
While {CONTRAST}, {SUBJ} ____ {OBJ}.
{SUBJ} ____ {OBJ}, a development that {IMPLICATION}.
Never before ____ {SUBJ} {OBJ}.
"While others may hesitate, leaders must make decisions."
"Scientists have discovered a cure, which offers hope to millions."
```

## 6. Distractor Vocabulary Progression

Distractors should match CEFR vocabulary level:

| Level | Distractor Examples |
|-------|---------------------|
| A1 | stop, avoid, ignore, forget, break, lose, hate |
| A2 | quit, skip, destroy, waste, reject, refuse, abandon, neglect |
| B1 | abandon, demolish, neglect, overlook, dismiss, postpone, cancel, terminate |
| B2 | disregard, suppress, undermine, circumvent, obstruct, impede, hinder |
| C1 | forsake, obliterate, renounce, repudiate, nullify, abrogate, rescind, countermand |

**Principle:** Distractors should be:
1. Semantic opposites or contextually inappropriate
2. Grammatically possible in isolation
3. Level-appropriate vocabulary
4. Clearly wrong in context

## 7. Domain Selection Strategy

### Avoid Domain Overlap Across Grammars
Track domain usage to ensure variety:

| Domain | Present Simple | Present Continuous | Past Continuous |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| cooking | - | A1 | - |
| restaurants | - | - | A2 |
| food | A1 | - | - |

### Domain Complexity by Level

| Level | Domain Type | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| A1 | Daily life, concrete | food, sports, pets, home |
| A2 | Leisure, activities | hobbies, travel, shopping |
| B1 | Personal development | career, education, health |
| B2 | Professional | finance, engineering, research |
| C1 | Academic/Policy | diplomacy, biotechnology, economics |

## 8. Irregular Verb Handling

For Present Perfect and Past Simple, track irregular forms:

| Base | Past Simple | Past Participle | Common Error |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| eat | ate | eaten | "eated" |
| see | saw | seen | "seed" |
| go | went | gone | "goed" |
| break | broke | broken | "breaked" |
| win | won | won | "winned" |
| know | knew | known | "knowed" |

**Wrong forms for irregulars must use correct irregular past simple:**
- ✅ Wrong: "ate" (for present perfect context)
- ❌ Wrong: "eated" (not a real word)

---

## 9. Context Markers by Grammar

Each grammar has specific time/context markers:

| Grammar | Markers |
|---------|---------|
| Present Simple | every day, usually, always, sometimes |
| Present Continuous | right now, at the moment, currently, Look! |
| Past Continuous | at 8pm yesterday, when the phone rang, while |
| Present Perfect | already, just, ever, never, for, since |
| Past Simple | yesterday, last week, in 2020, ago |

**Critical:** Don't mix markers across grammars:
- ❌ "Since the study began, she is analyzing..." (requires present perfect continuous)
- ✅ "At the moment, she is analyzing..."

---

## 10. Adverb Placement Rules

### Never place adverbs between verb and direct object:
- ❌ "I am mitigating increasingly carbon emissions"
- ✅ "I am increasingly mitigating carbon emissions"
- ✅ "As emissions increase, I am mitigating carbon output"

### Safe adverb positions:
1. Beginning of sentence: "Currently, she is working..."
2. Before main verb: "She is currently working..."
3. End of sentence: "She is working currently."

## Summary Checklist

Before creating patterns, verify:

- [ ] Subject group matches grammar rules
- [ ] "It" only used with non-human activities
- [ ] Level-appropriate template complexity
- [ ] Wrong forms test actual errors (not synonyms)
- [ ] Distractors match CEFR vocabulary level
- [ ] Domain not already used for this grammar
- [ ] Context markers appropriate for grammar
- [ ] Adverbs correctly positioned
- [ ] Irregular verbs handled correctly
- [ ] 3 wrong forms per verb (exactly)
